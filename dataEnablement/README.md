## dataEnablement

The scripts in this folder are used mostly for reformatting data files, whether by converting format (e.g., .xlsx to .txt), extracting specific rows or columns, or rearranging and relabling variables or observations.

Where relevant, most scripts are also designed to download data from Synapse before making changes and uploading the new file.
